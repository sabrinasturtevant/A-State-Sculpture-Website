    <p>I am a senior studio artist, emphasizing in sculpture at Arkansas State University. The act of celebrating the unity, love, and emotion of life is the center of my artistic expression, and inhabits everything I create. I work primarily with florals and the abstract, using organic shapes, vintage color schemes, and found objects that play with themes of self-worth and connection.. My experiences, hardships, breakthroughs, relationships and observations are what shape the messages that I want to share with the world. Ultimately my art is about truly reaching the viewer; I want to provide them with my own truth and vulnerability so that they feel more
comfortable and confident in their own. </p>

    <p>I am a very ambiguous archer who majors in studio art and minors in art history with a emphasis in print making. I enjoy crocheting hats for the NEA cancer center in my free time as well as hiking. My core art that I create for enjoyment is textured mixed media, created with the intent for disabled viewers to touch the art as well as see it. I also have a Cat named Cat who is my muse.​ </p>

I am inspired by all things cutesy, colorful, and childlike. When not creating, you can find me sipping tea, petting my three cats I adore, or hunting for treasures in thrift stores.​ </p>

    <p>Hello there! Drake French here. I am a Digital Design major who enjoys many forms of art outside those of my major. Sculpture being one of my most enjoyed physical art forms due to its plasticity of medium and size. My sculpture work generally includes undertones or elements of my childhood, current events, and my other hobbies such as writing or video games. Hope you enjoy the work my classmates and I create! </p>

    <p>I am a graphic design major currently living in my hometown of Forrest City, Arkansas. My design work tends to be minimal and I love to use a lot of white space. This does not mean I never work elaborately—I can get very detailed in some of my traditional artworks. As of now, I am finding ways to combine graphic design and sculpture. It is a challenge that I hope will broaden my abilities as a designer.</p>

    <p>My name is Tyler Lee. I’m a total goofball who’s obsessed with Pokémon. I’m heavily inspired by comics, manga, and anime and I’m aiming to become an illustrator and animator. My work in art typically draws from fascinating concepts that make me think about them for prolonged periods of time or from more personal ideas that are somehow a reflection of a part of me. </p>

    <p>I grew up and live in Brookland, AR. I am a Graphic Design major at ASTATE. I enjoy working with various aspects of art, whether it be graphic design or traditional art. I am currently interested in working with video, film and animation. I personally feel artists should be willing to work with all different types of art and mediums. Life is too short to not experiment with new techniques. I feel I am a Jack of all Trades in that I work with multiple mediums. Sometimes, I don’t even feel I have a particular style, I am able to explore new styles and will not hesitate to try something new if it means I can learn a new thing. ​ </p>
