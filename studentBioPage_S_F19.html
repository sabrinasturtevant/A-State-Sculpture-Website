    <p>What’s up, guys! I’m a junior from Cabot, Arkansas, and am majoring in graphic design. To me personally, sculpture has been a class that really gives me a break from the usual craft that comes with my major. I hope you guys enjoy the work that I create this semester and take a second to check out more of my projects on my Instagram: @ahueoflauren. </p>

    <p>Hi, I'm Madison. I'm currently studying Studio Art with an emphasis in sculpture here at Arkansas State. Throughout the past 4 years I have really pushed myself to become an artist that I am proud of. From the beginning, I have challenged myself to put personal meaning into each of my art pieces. Each art piece I create is a testimony of God's goodness in my life. When I see previous works I have created, I am immediately reminded of the season I was in, the things I overcame, and the blessings that poured over me. I hope that anyone from any walk of life can relate with my art and be inspired by it. ​ </p>
