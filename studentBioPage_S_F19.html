What’s up, guys! I’m a junior from Cabot, Arkansas, and am majoring in graphic design. To me personally, sculpture has been a class that really gives me a break from the usual craft that comes with my major. I hope you guys enjoy the work that I create this semester and take a second to check out more of my projects on my Instagram: @ahueoflauren.</p>
